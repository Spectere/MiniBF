This is a little interpreter for Urban MÃ¼ller's Brainfuck.

More information about Brainfuck can be found on [its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

This branch contains a much more, uh, *terse* version of the source code (sans one bug fix that I didn't feel like porting over).
